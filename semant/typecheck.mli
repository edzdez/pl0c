 * Typechecking.
 *
 * PL/0 only has one type: integers.
 * Typechecking is thus trivial, and hence perhaps doesn't warrant its own module.
 * We decided, however, to create this module regardless since we hope to add more types
 * to the language in the future.
 *
 * This step emits errors for:
 *  - Invalid Types
