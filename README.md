# PL/0c

A compiler for the [PL/0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/0) programming language written in OCaml.

The language has been extended to support the following features:

- Comments of the form `{ ... }`.
- Input and output, respectively handled by operators `?` and `!`.

In the future, we hope to support some additional features:

- Floating-point numbers.
- Strings.
- `else` and `else if`
- Arrays.
- Procedure arguments.
